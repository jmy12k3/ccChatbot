# ccChatbot

A highly customizable chatbot which could be trained with custom corpus.

All code comments are generated by Github Copilot; I do not gurantee the correctness of the comments.



## Note

- The corpus must be **a pair of statement and response**
- You could write your own parser for corpuses with other format into **.tsv format**

   

### Roadmap

* [x] Better text cleaning
* [ ] Better documentation
* [ ] To filter text by MAX_LENGTH instead of clamping
* [x] To save a subclassed model with optimizer state instead of weights only
* [ ] To support attention weights plotting
